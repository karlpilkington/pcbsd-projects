What is SwapExd?
=============================

The Swap Exender Daemon (or swapexd) is a program that monitors
how much swap space is available on the system. When the operating
system is running out of swap space, swapexd attempts to create
a new, larger swap file. When the operating system no longer needs
so much swap space, swapexd decreases the size of the swap file.



License information
=============================

The Swap Extender daemon (swapexd) is licensed under the BSD
license. Please see the accompanying LICENSE file for details.




Get and install SwapExd
=============================

Once you have downloaded the package, unpack the tarball

tar zxf swapexd-0.1.tar.gz

To compile swapexd, enter into the swapexd directory
and run the command

make

Optionally, you can install swapexd by running

make install

Later, should you wish to remove swapexd from the system, run

make deinstall


Should you also wish to compile the test program, which
will consume large amounts of memory in order to force
swapexd to act, run

make testswap



Note: Should you wish to enable debug messages in swapexd, add the text
"-DDEBUG" to the FLAGS (forth line) of swapexd's Makefile. This will
cause swapexd to display current swap usage and tell us what actions the
program is about to take.




The configuration file
============================

The configuration file for swapexd is, by default
/etc/swapexd.conf
This file is not required and, should it be missing,
swapexd will attempt to use sane default. At this time
the configuration file supports the following variables:

SWAP_FILE: This is the location where we want to place
	   swap files. There should be plenty of space available
	   at this location.
	   The default value is /usr/swap/swap0

GROW_BUFFER: When the operating system has *less* than this amount
	     of swap space available, swapexd will attempt to
	     add more. The value should be given in megabytes.
	    
REDUCE_BUFFER: When the operating system has *more* than this amount
	       of swap space free, swapexd will try to shrink the
	       swap file. The size should be given in megabytes.

DELTA_SIZE: When growing or shrinking the swap file, swapexd will
	    adjust the size of the swap file by this much.
	    The delta value should be given in megabytes.
	    DELTA_SIZE should be LESS than REDUCE_BUFFER to
	    avoid situations where swapexd is constantly growing
	    and shrinking the swap space.

WAIT_TIME: This is the minimum amount of time swapexd will pause
	   between checking the swap stats. The wait time should
	   be specified in seconds.



Running Swapexd
============================

The swap extender daemon supports the following command line options.

-v			print version info and exit
-h			print help message and exit
-d			run in background (daemon mode)
-daemon			run in background (daemon mode)
-c <config file> 	use alternative config file
-p			place a PID file in /var/run


The Swap Extender Daemon runs until it receives a termination signal
SIGINT or SIGTERM. Upon receiving either signal, it cleans up its memory,
removes any swap files it is working with and exits. By default, swapexd
runs in the foreground. However, running swapexd with either the
"-d" or "-daemon" command line arguments causes the program to run in
the background. 


The test program, Test, that comes with swapexd can be run by
running "make testswap" followed by "./Test". This program grabs
memory in 1MB chunks, filling the memory it grabs with random data.
The program pauses briefly after every 10MB to let other programs
run unchallenged. This allows us to see how swapexd performs as
memory is quickly consumed. The Test program accepts one argument,
how many 1MB chunks to allocate. For example, the following command
will allocate 1024 1MB chunks, or 1GB of memory.

Test 1024

Running Test without any arguments causes Test to default to allocation
2048 1MB chunks of RAM. once Test has consumed its upper limit of
RAM, it slowly unallocates the memory, giving it back to the system
and giving us the chance to see how swapexd performs while reducing
swap space.
