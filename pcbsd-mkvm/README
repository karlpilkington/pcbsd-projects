This is a stand-alone version of the scripts we are using for PC-BSD
to automatically generate VirtualBox / VMware images disk images. They use the
pc-sysinstall scripts in 9.0 to install to a md device, and then convert
the resulting file into the VM disk images. You'll need the VirtualBox
package on the system for this to work, since it uses the VBoxManage
utility for the final conversion steps.

To begin take a look at the makeimages.sh script, and be sure to read / set any
of the user options to your preferences.

You can also customize the pc-sysinstall.cfg files to change disk options, 
users, passwords, etc.
